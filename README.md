# tech-interview-project-1
A backend project I did for a tech interview, API and company name will be removed under the NDA.

Description:

Built with Node.js and Express.js, build a route that accepts 3 different parameters, tags(required), sortBy, and direction. It will make a GET request to a private API with the tags parameter, to retrieve a JSON object, then filter the result using the direction and sortBy parameters, at the same time, making sure there isn't any duplicated items. Finally, return the sorted results back to user in JSON format.
